# Finite element moddelling (FEM) material property optimisation codes

These codes allows you to determine the optimal combination of Elastic modulus and Poisson Ratio in your FEM using digital volume correlation (DVC) data.

Run the main code FEMOptimisation.m for executing FEM optimisation pipeline, and it will run the rest functions.

Replace with all file paths with yours before running.

DVC strain data needs to be prepared in advance.

This code allows you to perform global optimisation on a bunch of selected nodes. Define a set of nodes as SET-1 in your FEM.
