# FEM-codes

Run the main file FEMOptimisation.m for FEM optimisation pipeline, and it will run the rest functions.

Replace with all file paths with yours before running.

DVC strain data needs to be prepared in advance.

This code allows you to perform global optimisation on a bunch of selected nodes. Define a set of nodes as SET-1 in your FEM.
